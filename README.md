A capped lazy supply ERC20 token project. 

basic idea:
1. create a token with a cap
2. it will release tokens to specific addresses every day and half the supply each day.
the person who wants to recieve the tokens will have to stake some ether to the contract.

3. rest basic erc20 functionalities.
